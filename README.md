## Notes and Assumptions
The input file is converted to uppercase explicitly when loaded into memory. Hence, search strings have to be of uppercase characters to find matches correctly.

## Running
The executables are located in "Compiled Executables" for macOS and Windows.

## Troubleshooting
If the compiled executables do not function as intended, the codes located at "Source Code" can be recompiled.
